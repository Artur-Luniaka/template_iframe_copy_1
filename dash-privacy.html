              <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
              <p>
                This financial simulation does not collect real personal or
                banking information. All account balances, transactions, and
                investment data exist only temporarily during your session for
                demonstration purposes.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
              <p>
                As an educational banking simulator, no actual financial data is
                processed. The simulated transactions and portfolio growth are
                algorithmic demonstrations of financial concepts.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
              <p>
                Since this simulation doesn't collect real user data, there's no
                information to share with third parties. All financial scenarios
                are self-contained within the game environment.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Data Security</h3>
              <p>
                While demonstrating security practices common to banking apps,
                no sensitive data is actually stored. The encryption and
                authentication features shown are for educational demonstration
                only.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Your Rights</h3>
              <p>
                As no real financial data is collected, standard banking privacy
                rights don't apply. This simulation exists purely to demonstrate
                financial app interfaces and mechanics.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
              <p>
                This simulation doesn't connect to actual banking APIs or
                financial institutions. All market data and transaction
                processing are simulated for educational purposes.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
              <p>
                While this financial simulator is family-friendly, it doesn't
                collect data from any users. The educational content is suitable
                for all ages interested in learning basic finance concepts.
              </p>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
              <p>
                This static policy demonstrates how real banking apps document
                privacy practices. As a portfolio project, no actual policy
                updates occur.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Contact Information</h3>
              <p>
                For demonstration purposes only: this financial simulation isn't
                a real banking service and has no operational contact channels.
                It's an educational project about financial interfaces.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
              <h3>Effective Date</h3>
              <p>
                This policy reflects standard financial app disclosures but
                governs no actual data collection. It's effective for
                demonstration purposes as of the project creation date.
